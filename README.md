Hi there, I'm CybeRiz~

The 'Sakurazaka46 Database' is just a little fandom project set up by me, a newbie on both programming and github.

(It's still far away to call this a database btw...... A long way to go)

I'm now a cute university student drowning with assignments and labs, so I may not have much time for development or maintainence or so on.

If you find any bugs or problems, feel free to contact me on Twitter or discord!(If you can find me on the sakucen server)
